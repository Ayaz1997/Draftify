## Style Guidelines:

- The app is designed to convey trustworthiness and precision. Its primary color is a desaturated blue (#748DA6). This color evokes a sense of reliability and professionalism. It isn't overly vibrant, as that could distract from the app's purpose: to complete important documentation-related tasks. It contrasts well with a light background, ensuring readability.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#45B8AC) to highlight key actions and interactive elements.
- Clean and professional sans-serif fonts for clear readability.
- Simple, geometric icons to represent document types and actions.
- Clear and intuitive layout with a focus on ease of navigation and form completion.
- Subtle transitions and animations to guide users through the document creation process.
